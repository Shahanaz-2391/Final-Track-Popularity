Track Popularity Prediction: This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model to predict the popularity of music tracks based on various audio features. The model utilizes XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, for classification tasks. The dataset includes attributes such as track genre, artist, and other musical characteristics to assess the potential popularity of a song.

Project Overview: The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate the popularity of a music track, providing useful insights for music producers, streaming platforms, and artists. The project involves several steps, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

Key Steps:
1.	Data Preprocessing: Loading and cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
2.	Model Training: Using XGBoost Classifier to train the model with hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
3.	Evaluation: Evaluating the model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and visualizing the confusion matrix.
4.	Prediction: Predicting track popularity based on audio features such as duration, loudness, tempo, and genre.
Model
The model used for predicting track popularity is an XGBoost Classifier. XGBoost is a gradient boosting algorithm that excels at classification tasks and handles complex relationships in the data effectively. The model is trained with 1000 estimators (trees) and a random seed for reproducibility.
Key Evaluation Metrics:
•	Accuracy: Measures the proportion of correct predictions.
•	Precision: Indicates how many of the positive predictions were correct.
•	Recall: Measures how many actual positive cases were captured by the model.
